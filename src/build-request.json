        "The dialog remains responsive on small screens (e.g., uses viewport-relative sizing and does not overflow the viewport).",
        "The task list content remains usable at the larger size: the table area scrolls (vertically and, if needed, horizontally) without clipping important columns (e.g., Assignee, Captain, Actions).",
        "No changes are made to read-only Shadcn UI component sources under frontend/src/components/ui; sizing is applied via composition (e.g., DialogContent className) in app components such as frontend/src/components/TaskDetailDialog.tsx."
