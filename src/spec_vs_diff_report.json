However, the diff summary does not provide concrete evidence that the React Query bulkCreateTasks hook typing/payload was updated to make owner optional. The component also introduces accepting Excel file extensions, which was not requested.",

      "reason": "The provided diff content does not include the actual changes to frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts (only a high-level summary in frontend-file-summaries.txt), so there is no direct evidence that the mutation payload typing/shape was changed to make owner optional/omittable and that BulkUploadSection uses that new shape.",
