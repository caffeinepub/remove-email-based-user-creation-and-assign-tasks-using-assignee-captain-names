  "summary": "Diff adds US currency formatting utility, updates Dashboard to compute and display Total Revenue, and updates TaskDetailDialog (and likely TasksPage) to display per-task Revenue. Dashboard drill-down handlers for category/status/payment status are present, and a stateful TaskDetailDialog setup remains.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-33",
      "requirement": "Make the Dashboard \"Total Tasks\" card clickable to open TaskDetailDialog showing all tasks, with clear English title/description indicating all tasks.",
      "reason": "The provided Dashboard.tsx snippet shows state and handlers for category/status/payment status drill-down, and the file summary claims Total Tasks is clickable, but the truncated diff excerpt does not include the actual \"Total Tasks\" card implementation or the specific click handler and dialog title/description for the all-tasks view.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx (truncated)"

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Add a Revenue column / currency formatting usage in the main Tasks page task list (TasksPage), beyond the explicitly requested Dashboard KPI and TaskDetailDialog column.",
      "reason": "REQ-34 explicitly calls out adding a new Dashboard KPI card and updating the Dashboard task list dialog table (TaskDetailDialog). The diff shows TasksPage.tsx importing formatCurrency, implying additional revenue formatting/column changes on that page.",
